# Promise minimum time

> Set a minimum time for your promise. 

**This library could be useful if we want a promise to complete after at least some minimum time.**
**It does not delay the request, it just defines a minimum time in order to be completed**


For example if a modal with a loading indicator opens when we export some data, we want to be sure 
that modal with the loading indicator will be shown for at least some time(2 second for example)
before it closes. So with this library we can make the export request to completed after at least some
minimum time in order to be sure that the modal stays open for at least some minimum time.
